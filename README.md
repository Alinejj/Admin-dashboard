# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a web application designed to manage and organize essential business or organizational data efficiently. It provides features such as user authentication, data visualization, and a responsive interface for easy navigation. This project includes a backend for handling data storage and API requests, and a frontend for displaying and interacting with the data. It's built to simplify administrative tasks and improve overall productivity.

Progress So Far
In the development of the Admin Dashboard, the following features have been implemented:
- Login: Users can securely log in using their registered credentials.
- Signup: New users can create accounts with a simple registration process.
- Forgot Password: A feature allowing users to request a password reset if they forget their credentials.
- Reset Password: Users can reset their password using a unique token sent via email.
Currently, the reset password functionality is experiencing issues with the token, which is causing unexpected server crashes.
